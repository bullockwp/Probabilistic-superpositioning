# Probabilistic programming for protein super-positioning.

â€“ PyMC3 (Theano) implementations of Bayesian inference models for protein structural alignment. Uses MAP optimization to find the mean structure which is established as an unknown prior.  
- 8 week project timeframe.  
- 3 models exist:  
	-'Fixed mean' - proof of concept with toydata and a known solution.  
	-'1ENH' -  Real protein data as a probabilistic mean structure.  
	-'1IRH' - Two similar but different real proteins with an unknown superposition.  
  
Conclusion:  
Good reulsts with truncated proteins but fails with full-length chains -> could benefit from more time in deveolping informative priors, strong proof of concept.  

Implicaitons:  
Prof. Thomas Wim Hamelryck (University of Copenhagen) has taken custody of the project and is developing it further as PhD opportuinity.
